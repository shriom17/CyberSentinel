## 🎤 Sample Demo Scripts

### Script 1 - Technical (30 seconds):
```
"Here's our authentication system. We support traditional 
username/password login, but I want to show you something 
cooler - Google OAuth integration.

[Click Google button]

Watch this - one click, and we're authenticated using OAuth 2.0. 
The system verifies the Google credential, generates a JWT token, 
and we're instantly in the dashboard. No passwords to remember, 
enterprise-grade security, consumer-friendly experience.

This is production-ready and can scale to thousands of users."
```

### Script 2 - Business Focused (30 seconds):
```
"User experience is critical for adoption. That's why we've 
integrated Google Sign-In.

[Click Google button]

Law enforcement officers can use their organizational Google 
accounts for instant, secure access. No training needed - they 
already know how to use Google.

This reduces support costs, improves security, and speeds up 
deployment in real-world agencies."
```

### Script 3 - Hackathon Judges (30 seconds):
```
"Every modern application needs solid authentication. We went 
beyond basic login/password.

[Click Google button]

OAuth 2.0 integration with Google - the same technology used by 
Facebook, Spotify, and GitHub. We're not just building a demo, 
we're building production-ready infrastructure.

One-click access, JWT tokens, role-based permissions, and it 
scales to millions of users."
```
